          <h2>Shear-Flow Stabilized Z-Pinches</h2>
          <p>
            Fusion energy requires high energy plasmas, but confining and
            stabilizing plasma is notoriously difficult. One longstanding
            proposal is to use shear flow to stabilize Z-pinches. I'm currently
            simulating Shear-Flow Stabilized (SFS) Z-Pinches using the Gorgon
            MHD Code developed by Professor Jerry Chittenden of Imperial College
            London. We are using a radial wire array to generate shear flow over
            the surface of an axial target wire.

          <p>
            This summer, as I was teaching tree climbing in the Giant Sequoias of California, I found this beautiful piece of giant sequoia wood, and I am planning to make it into a charcuterie board. I haven't done a lot of woodworking before (only in middle school teach class!), so I am very excited!

          <h2>Fire Alarm Clock</h2>
          <p>
            Two years ago, when Cornell was renovating the Baker 200 Lecture
            Hall, I collected a disposed fire alarm and its "pull down" handle.
            I am now designing an "fire alarm clock" where the handle is pulled
            to turn off the alarm! My plan is to use an arduino, a DS3231
            Real-Time Clock, and an OLED display.
